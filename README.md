# Arduino PET filament puller
This project is Arduino UNO shield and minimalistic firmware for "Petalot PET Bottle to 3D filament" or another device with similar mechanics.

For more infromation about Petalot and its construction read at https://github.com/function3d/petalot.

This alternative board version based on parts and components found in a junk box, such as old Arduino UNO/Duemilanove, MX1508 stepper controller, external 12-13V power suppply, EM257 stepper from old printer, unlike origintal version it does not use WiFi remote control.

NB! PCB board is designed to be suitable for CNC milling, so some layout design decisions might look somewhat illogical.
