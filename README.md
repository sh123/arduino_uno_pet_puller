# Arduino PET filament puller
This project is Arduino UNO shield and minimalistic firmware for Petalot PET Bottle to 3D filament.

For more infromation about Petalot and its construction read at https://github.com/function3d/petalot.

This alternative firmware version based on Arduino UNO shield and MX1508 stepper controller, unlike origintal version it does not use WiFi remote control, also, it uses external 12-13V power supply.

NB! The PCB board is designed for CNC milling, so some layout design decisions might look somewhat illogical.
